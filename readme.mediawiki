Kidogo is 8 channel USB self powered digital signal injector. Kidogo system consists with Signal Editor and USB interface module. [https://github.com/downloads/dilshan/Kidogo/KidogoPlayer10077.zip Kidogo Player] is the Signal Editor of the Kidogo system and it can support up to 512 time slots (each range between 1''ms'' to 1''s'') with 8 channels.

==== Kidogo USB Interface ====

USB interface of the Kidogo system is based around Microchip's PIC18F2550 microcontroller and generate 5V CMOS and TTL compatible outputs. Dimensions of current version of Kidogo USB interface is 53mm x 40mm (using standard through-hole components) and this can be reduce into more by using PCB layout based on SMD components.

* Playback controls such as "Play to segment", "Play from segment", "Step back", "Step next" and "Clear"
* Shifting and rotating waveforms
* Invert, Reset, Clocking and Binary Generator functions
* Copy and Paste waveforms
* Mute function to each individual channel
* Launch without any installation or configuration (design to work as portable Windows application)
